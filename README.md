## 🎯 What is Beam?

Beam makes sending crypto as intuitive as sending an email. No more complex wallet addresses or gas fee worries. Simply use an email address to send USDC on the Avalanche network. Recipients get a secure, self-custody wallet created instantly via **Privy**, and can claim funds without needing native tokens for gas.

## ✨ Core Features

- **📧 Email-Based Transfers**: Send crypto using email addresses instead of complex `0x...` addresses
- **⛽ Gas-Free Claims**: Recipients don't need AVAX tokens to claim their funds
- **🔗 Multi-Channel Sharing**: Share claim links via email, WhatsApp, Twitter, or direct copy
- **🔐 Instant Wallets by Privy**: Secure, non-custodial wallets created automatically
- **🚀 Fast & Affordable**: Built on **Avalanche** for quick, low-cost transactions
- **🛡️ Secure Authentication**: Email-based login ensures only the intended recipient can claim funds

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### The "Sponsor Wallet" Pattern

Beam solves the classic "gas problem" for crypto newcomers through our innovative **Sponsor Wallet** architecture:

1. **Central Sponsor Wallet**: A pre-funded wallet that holds AVAX (for gas) and USDC reserves
2. **Simplified Sender Flow**: Senders only need to send USDC to the Sponsor Wallet in one transaction  
3. **Backend Gas Sponsorship**: Our backend uses the Sponsor Wallet to pay gas fees for recipient claims
4. **Gas-Free Experience**: Recipients claim funds without needing any native tokens

This creates a seamless experience where senders make one simple transaction and recipients claim funds with zero blockchain complexity.

## 🔄 User Flows

### 👤 Sender Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use Privy to connect your existing wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
2. **Enter Transfer Details**: Input recipient's email address and USDC amount
3. **Choose Sharing Method**: Select how to deliver the claim link:
   - 📧 **Email** (default, secure delivery)
   - 📱 **WhatsApp** sharing
   - 🐦 **Twitter/Social** sharing
   - 🔗 **Copy Link** (manual sharing)
4. **Send Funds**: One transaction sends USDC to the Sponsor Wallet
5. **Automatic Delivery**: System generates claim link and delivers via chosen method

### 👥 Recipient Flow

1. **Receive Claim Link**: Get the link via email, WhatsApp, social media, or direct share
2. **Open Claim Page**: Click link to view transfer details and amount
3. **Login with Email**: Use Privy to authenticate with the email address sender specified
4. **Automatic Wallet Creation**: If new to crypto, Privy creates a secure embedded wallet instantly
5. **Claim Funds**: One-click claim process with backend handling all gas fees
6. **Receive USDC**: Funds appear in your Privy wallet, ready to use
